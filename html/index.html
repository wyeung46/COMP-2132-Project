			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p>Click "Roll Dice" to roll a pair of dice 3 times for both you and your opponent. Whoever has the highest score at the end of the 3 rounds wins!</p>
            <p>If either player's two dice comes up as a 1, then the score for that round for the player is 0. eg: if the player rolls a 6 and a 1, they get a score of 0.</p>
            <p>If either player rolls a pair of the same numbers then the player's score is the total of the two dice times 2. eg: if a player rolls 5 and 5, they get a score of (5 + 5) * 2 = 20. But if they roll "Snake-Eyes" (1 and 1), their score will still be 0!</p>
            <p>If the player rolls any other combination of dice other than the ones mentioned above, then the player's score is the total value of the two dice, eg: player rolls a 3 and 2, player gets a score of 3 + 2 = 5.</p>
